            <h2>What is BMI?</h2>
            <p>
                Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple calculation used to assess whether an individual has a healthy body weight for their height. It is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters.
            </p>
            <p>
                BMI is an important measure because it helps to categorize individuals into different weight categories: underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese. This can help in identifying potential health risks associated with body weight and in making informed decisions about diet and lifestyle.
